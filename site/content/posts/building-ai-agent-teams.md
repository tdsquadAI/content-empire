The idea of a single AI coding assistant is already yesterday's news. The real frontier? **Teams of AI agents** that collaborate, review each other's work, and ship production code without constant human babysitting.

We've spent the last six months building and refining multi-agent development workflows. Here's what actually works — and what's still hype.

## Why Single Agents Hit a Ceiling

A single AI agent — whether it's Copilot, Cursor, or Claude — is remarkably useful for autocomplete, explaining code, and generating boilerplate. But ask it to build a complete feature across multiple files, write tests, handle edge cases, and deploy? It struggles.

The core limitation isn't intelligence. It's **context window management** and **task decomposition**. A single agent trying to hold an entire codebase in its head while making surgical changes is like a developer who refuses to take notes.

## The Multi-Agent Architecture That Works

After extensive experimentation, we've settled on a team structure that mirrors real engineering orgs:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Architect   │────▶│  Implementer │────▶│  Reviewer    │
│  (planning)  │     │  (coding)    │     │  (quality)   │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                    │                    │
       └────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
                     Shared Context Store
```

### Agent 1: The Architect

This agent reads the codebase, understands the existing patterns, and produces a structured implementation plan. It never writes code directly.

```python
architect_prompt = """
Analyze the codebase and produce a plan for: {task}

Output format:
1. Files to modify (with rationale)
2. New files to create
3. Dependencies to add
4. Test strategy
5. Rollback plan
"""
```

### Agent 2: The Implementer

Takes the architect's plan and writes the actual code. Crucially, it only works on one file at a time, keeping its context window focused.

```python
for file_task in architect_plan.files:
    context = load_relevant_context(file_task)
    result = implementer.execute(
        task=file_task,
        context=context,
        style_guide=project.style_guide
    )
    staged_changes.append(result)
```

### Agent 3: The Reviewer

Reviews every change the implementer produces. This is where the magic happens — the reviewer catches bugs, style violations, and logical errors before any human sees the code.

```python
review = reviewer.analyze(
    changes=staged_changes,
    original_plan=architect_plan,
    test_results=run_tests(staged_changes)
)

if review.approval == "REJECT":
    implementer.revise(review.feedback)
```

## The Secret Sauce: Shared Context Store

The biggest mistake teams make is treating agents as isolated workers. Without shared context, Agent B has no idea what Agent A decided or why.

We use a simple but effective pattern:

```python
class AgentContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decisions = []      # Why choices were made
        self.constraints = []    # What must not change
        self.file_index = {}     # What each file does
        self.test_results = []   # Latest test outcomes
    
    def add_decision(self, agent, decision, rationale):
        self.decisions.append({
            "agent": agent,
            "decision": decision,
            "rationale": rationale,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        })
```

This context store gets passed to every agent at every step. It's the institutional memory that prevents agents from contradicting each other.

## Real Results: What We've Shipped

Using this architecture, our agent team has successfully:

- **Built a complete REST API** (12 endpoints, auth, validation, tests) in 45 minutes
- **Migrated a codebase** from Express to Fastify with zero test regression
- **Created a React component library** with 20+ components, Storybook stories, and full TypeScript types
- **Fixed 34 bugs** from a backlog in a single afternoon — with the reviewer catching 3 additional bugs the original reports missed

## What Doesn't Work Yet

Let's be honest about the limitations:

1. **Complex architectural decisions** — Agents can implement patterns but struggle to choose between competing architectures
2. **Performance optimization** — They'll write correct code but rarely write *fast* code without explicit guidance
3. **Cross-service debugging** — When a bug spans multiple microservices, agents lose the thread
4. **UI/UX decisions** — Agents can build components but can't judge whether they're actually good

## Getting Started: A Minimal Setup

You don't need a complex orchestration framework. Start with this:

```yaml
# agent-team.yaml
agents:
  architect:
    model: claude-sonnet-4
    role: "Plan changes, never write code"
    context: ["codebase_summary", "recent_decisions"]
  
  implementer:
    model: claude-sonnet-4
    role: "Write code following the plan exactly"
    context: ["architect_plan", "style_guide", "relevant_files"]
  
  reviewer:
    model: claude-sonnet-4
    role: "Review for bugs, style, and correctness"
    context: ["changes", "test_results", "architect_plan"]

workflow:
  - architect: analyze_and_plan
  - implementer: execute_plan
  - reviewer: review_changes
  - if_rejected: goto implementer
  - if_approved: commit_and_push
```

## The Bottom Line

Multi-agent teams aren't a gimmick — they're the natural evolution of AI-assisted development. The key insight is that **specialization beats generalization**. An agent focused solely on code review will always outperform a general-purpose agent doing review as an afterthought.

Start small. Build a two-agent setup (implementer + reviewer) and measure the quality difference. You'll never go back to single-agent workflows.
